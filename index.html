    <p>
        Honors research project. I compared several methods of tokenization in a simple sentiment analysis task.<br>
        Primarily, I wanted to compare morphological tokenization and Wordpiece tokenization, with the hypothesis that morphological tokenization would perform better.<br>
        I also looked at inserting tokens to indicate capitalization for non-case-sensitive tokenization methods.<br>
        The results were somewhat inconclusive. I think it was because the task is pretty simple; a more complex task (e.g. translation) could have better results.
