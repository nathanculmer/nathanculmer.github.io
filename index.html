    <h2><a href="https://ideaexchange.uakron.edu/honors_research_projects/1831/">A Comparison of Lexical Tokenization Methods</a></h2>
    <p>
        Honors research project. I compared several methods of tokenization in a simple sentiment analysis task.<br>
        Primarily, I wanted to compare morphological tokenization and Wordpiece tokenization, with the hypothesis that morphological tokenization would perform better.<br>
        I also looked at inserting tokens to indicate capitalization for non-case-sensitive tokenization methods.<br>
        The results were somewhat inconclusive. I think it was because the task is pretty simple; a more complex task (e.g. translation) could have better results.

    <h2><a href="https://ideaexchange.uakron.edu/honors_research_projects/1831/">Transfer Learning for Ionic Liquid Property Prediction</a></h2>
    <p>
        Research work affiliated with <a href="https://blogs.uakron.edu/nrt-hde/">the NSF-NRT program</a><br>
        This work built on the series of works <italic>Extensive Databases and Group Contribution QSPRs of Ionic Liquid Properties.</italic> from Dr. Kamil Paduszynski.<br>
        These works modelled viscosity, surface tension, and density of ionic liquids from data on the functional groups present in those liquids.<br>
        We looked at how knowledge could be transferred from one model to another, with the goal of improving training time and required dataset size for modelling new properties.<br>
        We also looked at how pruning could be used to reduce the size of the model to increasing explainability, and how pruning networks would affect the knowledge transfer.<br>
        This poster was presented at the annual symposium for our research program.
